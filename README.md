It was a project that never got dedicated time and fizzled out in a way.  


The concept was to create a dynamic web page that a person could select or input certain
permissions from Facebook API and see the information that was returned from these permissions.  
It was to help developers understand permissions of Facebook but more importantly let the common 
user see the details these apps were getting based on permissions.  

For example, the user selects ‘candy crush’ game and presses submit -> this would return a page 
using the permissions in candy crush to show the user their data as well as possible friends data 
being viewed by this app.
